# The Book in 3 Sentences

<!-- 1. The book goes over human kind from the very beginning (when Homo Sapiens became the dominant species), up until the present and also dedicates a chapter speculating about how the current technological revolution will change us yet again
2. 'We' as people are discussed very much as a whole, the author does not - as a general rule - discuss specific demographics (segregated by race, gender, ethnicity etc.)
3.  —

# Impressions

This book was interesting, and surprising. 

I had recently watched a talk that the author gave (at the Oxford Union I believe, or perhaps it was a Google Talk) and was struck by how his answers always seemed to draw from different disciplines.

"You must draw wisdom from different sources Prince Zuko, otherwise knowledge becomes stale".

This book takes the same approach, it reads much more like storytelling than like a history book - it touches on science, economics, politics, religion and most importantly - the human imagination, the power of which was the most important takeaway from this book for me.

## Who Should Read It?

I really do think everyone should read it because:

1. It's not a difficult read
2. It touches on a broad range of topics
3. It can help us understand ourselves better

# How the Book Changed Me

How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.

- The biggest new idea that developed as a result of reading this book is that of objective, subjective, and inter-subjective realities, it is often the third that we as humans value the most

# My Top 5 Quotes

- "One of history's few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally, they reach a point where they cannot live without it."
- "The real test of 'knowledge' is not whether it is true, but whether it empowers us" *This is taken from Francis Bacon's scientific manifesto titled The New Instrument (1620). What sets the pursuit of knowledge apart know is that we accept that we do not know things. With religion, the approach was more often, 'if it were important, the bible would hold the answer. As it does not, it is not important*
- "People continue to conduct a heroic struggle against racism without noticing that the battlefront has shifted, and that the place of racism in imperial ideology has now been replaced by 'culturism'....assertions about the contrasting merits of diverse human groups are almost always couched in terms of historical differences between cultures rather than biological differences between races. We no longer say 'it's in their blood', we say 'it's in their culture'"
- "Consumerism has worked very hard, with the help of popular psychology ('Just do it!') to convince people that indulgence is good for you, whereas frugality is self-oppression"

# Summary + Notes

## 1. There is no such thing as 'unnatural'

If something happens, it is by definition 'natural'. When people say that something, such as homosexuality is unnatural, what they really mean is that something offends them personally by conflicting with their worldview, or their reality. It feels 'unnatural to them', because there are either inconsistencies between it and what they believe, which in turn threatens their identity, intelligence, ego or esteem.

> "No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesize, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other"

## 2. We live in an intersubjective world

What really sets humans apart from other animals is our collective ability to conceive, communicate and believe in imagined things.

It's a bit funny, children are told not to believe in fairy-tales or make-believe things, when really the only thing that sets these ideas from ideas like law, money and nations is a lack of widespread belief, due to a lack of utility. (The argument for the utility of fairy-tales or make-believe things could be another interesting thing to think about). 

As our feet hit asphalt made from sand, as we sit in chairs carved out of wood, our minds are often entirely preoccupied by things that exist only within the collective framework of all human minds - this emphasizes the fact that what's *real* is entirely up to us to define. **We will believe in anything, *anything*, so long as we believe that other people believe in it as well.** 

> "Many of history's most important drivers are inter-subjective: law, gods, money nations"

## 3. Religion and Politics are two sides of the same coin

So are diets like veganism for that matter - religion, politics, diets these are different frameworks that place a varying amount of emphasis on what we should believe, value, how we should act, what we should consume - they are guiding principals on how we can define ourselves, they are standards that we and others hold us to and as we move along to the more extreme end of the spectrum, they are doctrines we are compelled to share with others. 

This reminds me of something the author said in his aforementioned talk, he is 'ok with religion when it answers spiritual questions, but not when it starts telling people how they should act, who they can love, and how much of their bodies they can expose'.

This is perhaps where politics differ most from the other frameworks, it is so closely entwined with government and *laws*, the rules that are made to ensure we act a certain way, so that society can function a certain way. And this is perhaps why the separation of church and state has been emphasized in the past, it gets confusing when trying to uphold more than one set of frameworks (especially if they have the potential to contradict each other based on interpretation), and perhaps why it is so hard to do so - they are still fundamentally the same thing; ***frameworks of human behaviour**.*

> "Like Buddhists, Communists believed in a superhuman order of natural and immutable laws that should guide human actions"

## 4. "If you have why to live, you can bear almost any how"

Thank you Nietzsche. Happiness is not the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments, it's about seeing life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. 

We as people tend to make risk-averse choices, because the gains from winning something are overpowered by the losses felt when losing something of value. Now, take Stoicism into considerations. According to the Stoics, we can only control three things:

1. Our words
2. Our actions
3. Our emotions (Or rather how we react to our own emotions, I personally prefer the latter as it meshes much more nicely with Buddhism, the idea that we simply need to acknowledge, bow to, and embrace all emotions that arise within us)

Seeing as how we truly can't control much, the only path to happiness (or perhaps rather fulfillment?) is to turn inwards.

## 5. A reminder on Buddha's teachings

Material goods and immaterial goods must not be chased. Any of the feelings, good or bad, that arise within us, should be acknowledged, respected, and embraced. 

"This too, shall pass"

The bad, the hurt and pain and sorrow and disappointment, will pass. As will the good. We must not live in fear that the bad will persist or that the good will fail to do so, doing so accomplishes nothings. We must be like the soil that absorbs the rain, the sun, and all else. -->
