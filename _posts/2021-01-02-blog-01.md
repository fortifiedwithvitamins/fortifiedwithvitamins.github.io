# The Book in 3 Sentences

1. **Capitalism needs to be managed, not defeated;** right now it delivers for a lucky few, while leaving many others behind, but no other system has proven successful in delivering "delivering the innovations and economic growth that capitalism has sparked around the world" 
2. **The way to manage capitalism is to strengthen mutual obligations; ****WWI, WW2, The Space Race, these all contributed to a strong identity of what it means to be American, or Canadian, or English
3. **There are four areas where mutual obligations can be strengthened, the global level, the nation-state, the company, and the family**

<!-- # Impressions

Firstly, this was a difficult read. The last time I struggled so much through a book was reading Jill Lepore's 'These Truths'. This is due to two reasons; unfamiliar content, as well as English (grammar structure, vocabulary) that's much more sophisticated than the content I'm used to reading. That's alright though, I took my time and took what I could from the book. 

The moment I first came across the phrase 'social maternalism', I became skeptical. Alright, I thought, here we go - an affluent white man living in a prestigious university town is going to write about how we should simply be kind to each other. Good. 

But what is the root of this skepticism? Iris and I joke now and then about how much we hate capitalism for the very reasons that Collier touches on, it has become a virtuous cycle for a few often as a result of greed, corruption and at the expense of a vicious cycle trapping many. 

Am I skeptical because I, with my middle class upbringing (a class which is apparently vanishing), do not identify with being trapped in the virtuous cycle? And am thus offended by being trapped in the vicious cycle? Am I skeptical because of that mindset I've been trying so hard to break out of? The one in which I dismiss someone's viewpoint because they see the world from their tenured pedestal? Am I skeptical as a by-product of capitalism itself, the polarization that happens all too frequently? 

I read through [GatesNotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Future-of-Capitalism) before and after finishing the book in order to have a holistic view of the book, and found myself agreeing strongly with something that Bill wrote - I don't necessarily agree with (or understand) the solutions proposed, but I don't find myself disagreeing with Collier on the root of the problem. Capitalism created a lot of opportunities for a lot of people, but then at some point, all the benefits began concentrating within an ever decreasing demographic. It created cleavages in society, and now perpetuates them and cleavages, the idea of 'us' versus 'them' are what I believe to be the root of all the major problems we face today. 

## Who Should Read It?

# My Top 5 Quotes

- "In what is already recognized as a major advance, in *The Enigma of Reason* Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber show that reason itself has evolved for the strategic purpose of persuading others, not to improve our own decision-making"
- "Populists eschew even the rudimentary analysis of an ideology, leaping directly to solutions that ring true for two minutes. Hence, their strategy is to distract voters from deeper through through a kaleidoscope of entertainment. The leaders with these skills are drawn from another tiny pool: the media celebrities....often the two (populism and ideology) fused, becoming yet more potent: once-discredited ideologies refurbished with impassioned leaders peddling enticing new remedies."
- "In all modern societies, political power depends upon very modest levels of coercion and a high decree of willing compliance"
- "Lee Kwan Yew said 'I saw no reason why private landowners should profit from an increase in land value brought about by economic development and the infrastructure paid for with public funds'."
- "We need large shared identities, but nationalism is not the way to build them....it is instead being used by political populists to build support of hatred of other people living in the same country. The entire strategy is to build cohesion within one part of society by creating rifts with other parts of society....Historically, the most damaging forms of oppositional identity have been large-group identities such as ethnicity, religion and nationality"

# Summary + Notes

## 1. 'Us' versus 'Them i.e. oppositional identity causes all sorts of problems

And this shit is *actively encouraged by politicians*. Politics is no longer about shifting the those who may waver in the middle, it's about keeping those already with you. It's about stoking their egos, and the easiest way to do that is the **lazy way - the left politicians tell left-leaning voters that they're 'morally superior' and the right politicians tell right-leaning voters that they're 'realistic' and politicians across the spectrum tell everyone 'I represent you, and *unlike so-and-so....'.*** 

**It's easier to find the things that divide us than it is to find the things that unite us - especially as we become more and more polarized.** 

But this gets tricky in my head, because at a certain level - embracing our differences, fighting for representation are objectively good. Imagine sports teams without the teams, or POC and LGBTQ not fighting for the rights they deserve - but the question I can't answer right now is **where do we draw the line.** 

At what point does distinguishing between us and them become detrimental, instead of beneficial? And is there an objective answer to this? **Maybe the answer is a two-parter: Firstly, when establishing groups, ensure that no group is united based on a shared hatred / resentment towards other groups. Then, to maintain such groups, ensure the focus remains on a shared purpose.** 

> "I predict your behaviour by imagining how I would behave in your circumstances. But using this technique is only reliable to the extent that I am confident that we share the same belief system. If we have radically different belief systems, I cannot put myself in your shoes because I do not inhabit the mental world that shapes your behaviour. **I can't trust you**"

## 2. Narratives shape the world - are yours outdated?

This is a central theme in *Sapiens* as well, that the narratives we believe and more importantly, **the ones that we believe that others believe** dictate how we live our lives. But here's the thing, some narratives are outdated, so outdated in fact that they're no longer relevant. *But no one will ever tell us this, in fact, some people will lie out-right to maintain a certain narrative for their own benefit.*

And think of how confirmation bias works, more often than not, when confronted with conflicting narratives, or narratives that do not fit well in our belief system, we'll selectively choose to believe the narratives that require the least amount of cognitive work - these are the ones that already believe in. 

One great example is the idea that *we must* go to university. I certainly bought into this narrative, and though I don't regret my choice, I certainly do wish I had at least opened my mind to the possibility of other paths (though that's a really, really hard thing to do at 18)

I think it's really, really important to think about what we believe in, and why we believe in these things - and consistently challenge these things. Otherwise, we're too easily lied to. I don't like being lied to. 

> "They are producing people with the academic credential of a degree, but not with a skill. Young people are lured into debt that their qualification does not equip them to pay"

## 3. We have shifted responsibilities to the government that we cannot possibly expect them to realistically accomplish

Oh this ties in nicely with *Sapiens* as well. Beforehand, our families were literally everything - they were the bank ('Hey, I need a loan'), they were social security ('Hey, that loan didn't work out'), they were our health care system as well as our pension plan ('Grandma has been living with us since her hip did that thing') and now? The responsibilities have more or less all been shifted towards the government. And while the government can meet fiscal needs, there's nothing they can do to meet the emotional and phycological needs that we all have. 

## 4. The priority of publicly traded companies needs to change

The average tenure for a Fortune 500 company is 5 years because traditionally, it's all about profits. And how can a CEO maximize profits and obtain their golden parachute? Build strong, long-lasting relationships founded on trust with suppliers, vendors and customers - but that takes too long. Cut costs and investments aggressively - but the CEO before has already done so. Rearrange the books - shady, but as long as you don't get caught - good.

> "The investment rate of the companies whose shares are traded is 2.7%, that of those whose shares are privately held is 9%....profit is the constraining that forces discipline on a firm rather than defining its purpose"

When the finance sector makes up a significant % of GDP, things start going wrong. They offer insanely lucrative opportunities to the best and brightest, and drive up the going price for the best and brightest not just between firms in the finance industry, but also outside the industry as well as everyone wants the best and brightest. 

Is this changing? There's lots of money now pouring into tech, and these companies (FB, Tesla) are not necessarily profit-focused (or even profitable yet).

## 5. Getting what you want is often not straightforward

Just a good lesson to keep in mind.

> "...a signal is something that reveals your true type to the suspicious audience...Nobel Laureate Michael Spence saw that in order to prove you are not a rogue, you need to do something that would be prohibitively costly otherwise"

## 6. International organizations turned duties into power

> "The IMF morphed into a global fund like the World Bank, whose rationale was to meet duties of rescue. By their nature, duties of rescue are neither reciprocal nor conditional. But both organizations became dominated by an inner core of donor counties that turned duties to power by first making support conditional....but rescue is about **restoring and augmenting autonomy, all duties of rescue being with respect for those being rescued**" -->
