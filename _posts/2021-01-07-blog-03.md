# My Top 5 Quotes

- "Truth, like time itself, is a product of a conversation man has with himself about and through the techniques of communication he has invented."
- "Truth does not, and never has, come unadorned. It must appear in its proper clothing or it is unacknowledged, which is a way of saying that the "truth" is a kind of cultural prejudice"
- "The reader must come armed, in a serious state of intellectual readiness. He comes to the text along. In reading, one's responses are isolated, one's intellect thrown back on its own resources. To be confronted by the cold abstractions of printed sentences is to look upon a language bare, without the assistance of either beauty or community. Thus, reading is by its nature a serious business and is of course, an essentially rational activity"
- "The principal strength of the telegraph is its capacity to **move information, not collect explain or analyze it** "
- "Prior to the age of telegraphy, the information-action ratio was sufficiently close so that most people had a sense of being able to control some of the contingencies in their lives. **What people knew had action-value**"
- "**The problem is not that television presents us with entertainment, but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining**"

# Summary + Notes

## 1. We have been shaped by our methods of communication

I think about the times I've needed to apologize, and more often than not it felt much more difficult to do so in person, face-to-face, instead of through a written message. Much more difficult, and much more rewarding. Face-to-face interactions allow for minute body languages, a squeeze of a hand, a small smile, which can package what in a much more *effective* way. 

It's funny to think that I've never extensively considered how this is also true on a large scale, which is what this book discusses (maybe it's the goldfish living in a goldfish bowl situation?). 

The most popular social media platforms today all share the common feature of image bombardment, and are user interactions are characterized by continuous scrolling. This does things to us. 

1. **Our attention spans become shorter**
2. **We begin to lose our ability to consume information that requires an attention span greater than seconds** 
3. **We begin to expect all information to be presented in a quick, captivating way**

Our way of interacting with information is being continuously molded by how we interact with information, and this becomes increasingly problematic:

> "[Technology] has made it possible to move decontextualized information over vast spaces at incredible speed"

What is the issue with decontextualized information? It is incomplete, and open to interpretation. Postman gives an example using the statement "I prefer oranges to chocolate". While this might hold true when discussing wallpapers, it may no longer be true when discussing snack preferences. Decontextualized information places the responsibility of contextualizing on the consumer of the information, which is highly problematic due to the inherent biases that exist in our belief systems (confirmation bias a la crony beliefs). 

Also, how can we possibly understand the world if all we have are these individual, decontextualized data points? Without trends, and critical analysis of these trends, we will simply continue to believe whatever it is that we want to believe.

Postman also discusses a vicious cycle, in which:

## 2. Media of communication available determines what is communicated

As previously discussed, containers limit what is contained. Postman strongly believes that the form of communication that is slowly replacing written communication is highly problematic and much more detrimental that it is beneficial because:

- It removes all context
- It removes the need the need to think critically
- It removes accountability

> "The media of communication available to a culture are a dominant influence on the formation of the culture's intellectual and social preoccupations"

> "How television stages the world becomes the model for how the world is to be staged"

## 3. But maybe Postman is too critical?

The author wrote and published this book in the 1980s, before the internet really took off. Based on his opinions regarding television, I would assume that his views regarding the internet and social media especially would be similarly critical - I would assume that the world is more Huxley-ian than he had imagined possible. 

His criticisms are all very valid, but he didn't have the opportunity to see the democratizing effects of the internet. Anyone can learn anything via resources found online - video tutorials are especially wonderful for practical purposes, and recorded lectures from Google, Ted and the Oxford Union are hugely beneficial and would not be available to me otherwise. 

Maybe it isn't any form of media that's the issue, but rather *how we choose to adopt it* that is. If we choose to only consume information through one form of media, if we choose not to question it, this is when things become problematic. -->
