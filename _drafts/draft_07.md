"Is it ever ok for a person to lash out?"

A friend asked this the other day, and it's a tricky one.

Firstly, if this person is a jerk through and through, walking away from the conversation could be a good idea. In fact, walking away from this relationship altogether could be a great idea. But it isn't jerks who make this question a tricky one to answer. It's the people we care about who have the occasional jerk-ish outburst that complicate things. 

I think it's important to give people the benefit of the doubt because that's what I hope they would do for me. On gloomy days or anxious days I have certainly said things that I didn't mean, things that I regretted saying. On these days,

I want to give these people the benefit of the doubt, because that's what I hope they would do for me. On my gloomy days, or my anxious days I say things that I don't mean. And I would hope that the people who care for me choose to look past their feelings that I didn't mean to hurt and acknowledge that ...

This is not to say that we should tolerate ...

But I can say "What you said was hurtful, I know you didn't mean for it to be that way, but I was hurt by it. I understand you are stressed, please let me know I can do for you." 

Conversely, I can also say "What I said was hurtful, I didn't mean for it to be that way, but can understand why you are hurt by it. I am really stressed, and didn't mean to lash out"

I try to apply this to apologies as well - 
a good apology doesn't have any "ands" or "buts" in it. A good apology does not include my opinion or view point. A good apology focuses on acknolwedging how the person being apologized to felt in response to what 

"I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings, but you're really just too sensitive sometimes."
"I'm sorry that I left the dishes in the sink, but you leave your gym clothes on the floor all the time."
"I'm sorry I forgot what time we were meeting, things have been so busy"

Thanks for your time, thanks for reading.
