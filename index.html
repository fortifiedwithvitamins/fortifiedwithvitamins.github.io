<h1>Hi</h1>

<p>
	I created this website to practice my writing by writing about things like books that I've read, questions I have, and things that I've learned.
</p>
<p>
	If any of my thoughts or opinions pique your interest, please email me - I would love to hear from you! If any of my thoughts or opinions offend you or seem ignorant, please do the same - I would also love to hear from you.
