<h1>Hi</h1>

<p>
	I created this website to practice my writing by writing about things that interest me. This includes notes on books that I have read as well as questions that I think about now and then.
</p>
<p>
	If any of my thoughts or opinions pique your interest, please email me - I would love to hear from you! If any of my thoughts or opinions offend you or seem ignorant, please do the same - I would also love to hear from you.
</p>
